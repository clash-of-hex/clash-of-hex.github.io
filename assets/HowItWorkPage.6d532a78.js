All actions in the game are performed in a smart contract placed in the blockchain, which means that each action must be confirmed in the &quot;Ever Wallet&quot; from the account you have chosen to authorize in the game. The game is in test mode, so the test network &quot;testnet&quot; is used. Do not forget to switch to it in the wallet. Coins from the testnet you can always get in <a href="https://t.me/everdev_giver_bot">telegram bot</a>. </p><p>Interface</p><img src="'+n+'"><p>Game rooms</p><p> The panel displays all the current locations created by the players. To the right of each location is the number of players who have joined the game and the maximum number of players in the room. &quot;1/3&quot; means that the game joined 1 player out of 3. If not all seats are taken yet, you can join the game by pressing &quot;Join&quot;. The round starts as soon as the required number of players is reached. If the location is already filled with players, you can press &quot;Info&quot; and become an observer. </p><p> You can also create your own room. To do this, you need to specify &quot;Room name&quot;, select the maximum number of players and click &quot;Add&quot;.

The round lasts for 15 minutes. </p><p> Upgrade the level of your cell. To do this, mark the desired cell by clicking it once with the left mouse button, and then double-click the same cell with the left mouse button. You will lose 3k energy - this is the cost of the lvlap. Now the energy production rate of this cell has increased. </p><img src="'+c+'"><p> Wait until you accumulate 4k energy and capture the next cell. To do this, click on the cell near which you want to capture the cell and click on the cell you want to capture. You will lose 4k - this is the cost of the capture. Now you control two cells. </p><img src="'+h+'"><p> Wait until the energy of the cells fills up. Then transfer energy from the first cell to the second cell. To do this, select cell 1 and dbl click on cell 2. Now the energy of cell two has exceeded the base capacity and every second it will lose energy until it returns to the base capacity level. Hurry up to use your energy advantage in your tactics. </p><img src="'+p+'"><p> If you are adjacent to an enemy cell, you can attack and capture it if your energy exceeds the enemy&#39;s.
